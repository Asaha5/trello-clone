# Welcome to a very basic Trello-Clone

## Given time, I would love to implement following

- A proper data store/ state management library like Redux or Recoil.
- Certain validations.
- Additional features like deleting a list, editing a list label etc. So much can be done. I could also introduce drag and drop feature.
- I would love to improve the look and feel of the website.
- Unit tests. Couldn't take out time from the busy schedule this week. But I will try to add tests once I manage to get some free time. Hope it won't be a deal breaker. 
- TODO - So many other things.


## Note - Took some time out & added some unit tests
